# Comicaze (*kaa-mih-kaa-zee*)
Comicaze is a community driven database application that stores data from over 700 heroes and villains across multiple comic universes.
# Features
### User contributions  
Users that have created an account and are logged in, have the ability to contribute to any missing information for a character. After submission, information sent from the user will be reviewed for addition to the respective character.
### User profile
On successful sign up, a profile will be generated for the user and may personalize it with their photo.
### Search
A search bar that retrieves data from the database in "like" terms. For instance, a user can search for "Bat" and get all results that have "Bat" in their name. It is also case insensitive. A search term must be entered for a successful request.
# User flow
Users are met with a homepage that describes what the site is about along with a correct pronunciation of the site name. 
A user (whether they are logged in or not) have free reign to use the search function and absorb the material.

If a user chooses to create an account, they will have the ability to contribute to missing information on character profiles. The site is currently in early stages, so expect more features to be implemented in future updates.
